## Content Structure Rules

The template uses a **prefix-based ordering system** to control how pages appear in the sidebar. This gives you complete control over your documentation hierarchy.

## Naming Convention

All files and folders should follow this pattern:

```
NN-descriptive-name.mdx
```

Where:
- `NN` is a two-digit number (01, 02, 03, etc.)
- `descriptive-name` describes the content
- Extension is `.mdx` or `.md`

## File Types

### `.mdx` files
Full documentation pages with frontmatter and content.

**Required frontmatter:**
```yaml
---
title: "Page Title"
summary: "Short summary"
description: "SEO description"
---
```

### `.md` files (index files only)
Section/subsection titles for sidebar navigation.

**Required frontmatter:**
```yaml
---
title: Section Title
---
```

**Important:** Regular `index.md` files should only contain frontmatter—no body content.

## Example Structure

Here's a complete example showing all nesting levels:

```
content/
├── _index.mdx                    # Homepage (special file)
├── 01-changelog.mdx              # Top-level page
├── 02-introduction.mdx           # Top-level page
├── 03-getting-started/           # Section
│   ├── index.md                  # Section title
│   ├── 01-installation.mdx       # Page in section
│   ├── 02-quick-start.mdx        # Page in section
│   └── 03-configuration.mdx      # Page in section
└── 04-core-features/             # Section
    ├── index.md                  # Section title
    ├── 01-authentication.mdx     # Page in section
    ├── 02-data-management/       # Subsection
    │   ├── index.md              # Subsection title
    │   ├── 01-fetching.mdx       # Page in subsection
    │   └── 02-caching.mdx        # Page in subsection
    └── 03-ui-components/         # Subsection
        ├── index.md              # Subsection title
        ├── 01-buttons.mdx        # Page in subsection
        └── 02-forms.mdx          # Page in subsection
```

## Hierarchy Levels

### Level 1: Top-Level Pages

Files directly in `content/`:

```
content/
├── _index.mdx           # Special homepage
├── 01-changelog.mdx     # Regular top-level page
└── 02-introduction.mdx  # Regular top-level page
```

### Level 2: Sections

Folders with an `index.md`:

```
content/
└── 03-getting-started/
    ├── index.md              # Defines "Getting Started" section
    ├── 01-installation.mdx
    └── 02-quick-start.mdx
```

### Level 3: Subsections

Nested folders with an `index.md`:

```
content/
└── 04-features/
    ├── index.md
    └── 01-data/                # Subsection
        ├── index.md            # Defines "Data" subsection
        ├── 01-fetching.mdx
        └── 02-caching.mdx
```

## Special Files

### `_index.mdx`

The documentation homepage. Must be named exactly `_index.mdx` (with underscore prefix).

### `index.md`

Section and subsection titles. These should:
- Only contain frontmatter (title)
- Not include body content
- Be present in every section/subsection folder

## MDX Examples

### Full Documentation Page

```mdx
---
title: "Getting Started with Authentication"
summary: "Learn how to implement authentication"
description: "A comprehensive guide to implementing secure authentication in your application using our auth system."
---

## Introduction

Authentication is a critical part of any application...

## Basic Setup

First, install the authentication package:

```bash
npm install @your-org/auth
```

Then initialize it in your app...

<InfoAlert>
Make sure to store your API keys securely!
</InfoAlert>

## Next Steps

Now that you have authentication set up, you can...
```

### Section Index File

```md
---
title: Getting Started
---
```

That's it! No body content needed.

## Custom Components in MDX

You can use custom React components in your MDX files:

```mdx
<InfoAlert>
This is helpful information for your users.
</InfoAlert>

<WarningAlert>
Be careful with this configuration!
</WarningAlert>
```

To add more custom components, edit the `MDXContent` component and pass them to the `components` prop.

## Best Practices

1. **Use descriptive names** - `01-installation.mdx` is better than `01-setup.mdx`
2. **Keep numbering consistent** - Use 01, 02, 03 (not 1, 2, 3)
3. **Group related content** - Use sections and subsections logically
4. **Write complete frontmatter** - All three fields help with SEO and navigation
5. **Start sections at 01** - Each folder's numbering should restart at 01

## Common Mistakes

❌ **Missing index.md in sections:**
```
content/
└── getting-started/        # Missing index.md
    └── 01-installation.mdx
```

✅ **Correct:**
```
content/
└── 01-getting-started/
    ├── index.md            # Required!
    └── 01-installation.mdx
```

❌ **Body content in index.md:**
```md
---
title: Getting Started
---

This section covers... ← Don't do this
```

✅ **Correct:**
```md
---
title: Getting Started
---
```

❌ **Inconsistent numbering:**
```
01-first.mdx
2-second.mdx    # Missing leading zero
03-third.mdx
```

✅ **Correct:**
```
01-first.mdx
02-second.mdx
03-third.mdx
```
