## Usage inside a monorepo

This page explains the minimal steps to install the docs-template into an existing monorepo and run the documentation locally. The template is designed to be dropped under the `/docs` folder of your repository and wired into pnpm workspaces.

Follow these steps:

1. Create a repository (or use an existing one)

   - You can start from our example stack `@forge42/open-source-stack` or any repo you control. The important part is that you can add a `/docs` folder and control the repository root (where `.github`, `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, etc. live).

2. Download and extract the docs-template into your monorepo

   - Download the `docs-template` files from the main branch (or copy the template contents) and extract them into the repository root inside a `docs/` directory.

   - Make sure your root `pnpm-workspace.yaml` includes the `docs` package so pnpm can hoist and link the docs project. Example snippet:

   ```yaml
   packages:
     - packages/*
     - test-apps/*
     - docs
   onlyBuiltDependencies:
     - '@biomejs/biome'
     - esbuild
     - lefthook
   ```

   (Add `docs` to the `packages` array if it isn't already present.)

3. Move or add workflow files to `.github/workflows` in the monorepo root

   - The template includes CI workflows (for example: `ci.yml`, `publish-documentation.yml`, and `pr-close.yml`). Move these into your repository root under `.github/workflows/` so GitHub Actions can find and run them.

   - The workflows use Fly.io and the template `fly.toml` and `Dockerfile`. If you don't use Fly, you can customize the workflows or remove those steps.

4. Check and resolve FIXME comments inside workflows

   - Open the workflow files and search for `FIXME` markers. They typically indicate environment-specific values, secrets, or configuration you must provide (e.g., Fly app name, secret names, or publishing settings). Resolve those before relying on the workflows.

5. Make sure you have a `/content` folder with documentation pages

   - The template ships with example content in `docs/content` that briefly explains how the template works. Remove those example files and add your own documentation content (for example: `01-getting-started.mdx`, `02-project-structure.mdx`, etc.).

6. Install and run locally

   - From the repository root run:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   pnpm run dev
   ```

   - After `pnpm run dev` the docs server will start (see terminal output for the local dev URL). Open the URL in your browser to preview the site.

Notes and tips

- If your monorepo already has a `docs/` package, merge carefully to avoid overwriting important files.
- Keep `fly.toml` and `Dockerfile` at the root of the `docs` package (or where the workflows expect them). If you move them, update the workflow paths accordingly.
- Verify `pnpm-workspace.yaml` indentation and syntax — YAML parsing errors can stop workspace linking.
- If you use a different package manager or CI provider, adapt the commands and workflow steps.

Troubleshooting

- If `pnpm run dev` doesn't start, check that you executed it from the repo root and that `docs/package.json` contains the `dev` script (template normally wires this up).
- If the site shows example content, remove the template example files from `docs/content` and add your own pages.

That's it — these steps will get the template running inside your monorepo and prepared for CI/publishing. If you want, I can also:

- Verify `pnpm-workspace.yaml` in your repo includes `docs` (I can open the file and confirm if you want).
- Run a quick smoke test locally (you'll need to allow me to run commands).

If you'd like me to make further adjustments (different wording, screenshots, or additional examples), tell me what to include.
